# UnityRotation
Unity Package to explore Rotations using Vectors and Quaternions

All you got to do to get it working is to open a fresh project and remove any existing Camera's and other items from the default Scene.

Then import the prefab and place it in the scene.

In the scene there is a cube set up in the middle with the Axis bars shown in green, red, and blue.

Have a look at this object in the Editor and check out the script called Rotations.

Have a read through the code (most of which is not my own and comes from the Unit3d Manual examples for the functions called).

The script runs in the Editor but it's better in Run mode (don't maximize it or you cannot play with the script while it's running).

You can use the Move Camera button to shift from 2D to a 3D view (3D is better).

Click Play and start messing round with the tick boxes and sliders of the Rotation script in the Editor.

The first section plays with Vectors to rotate the cube and the seconds uses Quaternions.

There is a summary of what's happening in the script on the screen but having the code open while you play helps understand what's going on a little easier.

There is a bit more info and a demo on my blog here: http://www.zuluonezero.net/2019/03/31/unity-how-to-rotate/(opens in a new tab)
